[replication.io](http://www.replication.io/) is a community center for databases
and services that support Apache CouchDB-style replication. We are working
to expand the definition and specification to encompass the growing family
of databases that support HTTP-based, multi-master replication.

## Objective

Apache CouchDB was created with multi-master replication built into its foundation.
The list of databases supporting this multi-master replication style has grown over
the past half decade.

> The goal of this project is to combine our communities around our shared strength.

## Contribute

First steps are focused on consolidating all the content about "CouchDB-style
replication." Next steps will be focused on simplifying the specification document,
making it broadly inclusive, re-implementable, and testable.

The largest part of work needed is building a "testing rig" that would allow all
databases to test-against-the-spec. There are various "testing rigs" scattered
throughout the communities. Consolidating those efforts would be a good first step.
