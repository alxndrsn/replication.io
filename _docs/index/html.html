<p><strong>replication.io</strong> is a community center for databases and services that support Apache CouchDB-style replication. We are working to expand the definition and specification to encompass the growing family of databases that support HTTP-based, multi-master replication.</p>

<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>

<p><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">Apache CouchDB</a> was created with multi-master replication built into its foundation. The <a href="databases">list of databases</a> supporting this multi-master replication style has grown over the past half decade.</p>

<p class="well"><em>The goal of this project is to combine our communities around our shared strength.</em></p>

<h3 id="beyond-databases">Beyond Databases?</h3>

<p>The replication format and process is a simple exchange of document and revision identifiers. It has been implemented in single node, multi node, mobile, and even web browser-based databases. It can go even farther. Anything that can support a by-sequence index and tracks changes to its content (be it a database, a file system, web service, or perhaps even hardware and sensors), could support multi-master replication.</p>

<p>Initial work has been done to define the originating implementation done in Apache CouchDB (see <a href="spec">Specification</a>). Work is underway to provide a specification as well as testing environments that encompasses this family of databases, and provides a framework for future implementors to use in testing their databases, filesystems, services, or hardware.</p>

<p>We encourage anyone with an interest and/or implementation in multi-master replication to join this documentation and testing effort.</p>
