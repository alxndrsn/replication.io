<a name="what-is-replicationio" class="anchor" href="#what-is-replicationio"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is replication.io</h3>

<p><a href="http://replication.io/">replication.io</a> is intended to be a community center for databases and services that support "Apache CouchDB-style replication." We are working on building out the definition/spec, testing compatibility, and exploring what's next for multi-master, MVCC-based replication.</p>

<h3>
<a name="why-this-is-needed" class="anchor" href="#why-this-is-needed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why this is needed</h3>

<p><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">Apache CouchDB</a> was created with multi-master replication built into its foundation. The list of databases supporting this multi-master replication style continues to grow. The goal of this project and web site is to combine our communities around our shared strength.</p>

<h3>
<a name="who-this-is-for" class="anchor" href="#who-this-is-for"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who this is for</h3>

<p>Users. Freeing user data to move with the user--among all the various types of devices they use now and will use in the future--is key to going "beyond the cloud" and enabling an Internet of Things that is sustainable and resilient.</p>

<h3>
<a name="beyond-databases" class="anchor" href="#beyond-databases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Beyond Databases?</h3>

<p>The replication format and process is a simple exchange of document and revision identifiers. It has been implemented in single node, multi node, mobile, and even web browser-based databases. It can go even farther. Anything that can support a by-sequence index and tracks changes to all the contents of something (be it a database, a file system, web service, or even hardware-monitored storage), could support multi-master replication.</p>

<h3>
<a name="collaborate-and-contribute" class="anchor" href="#collaborate-and-contribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collaborate and Contribute</h3>

<p>We encourage anyone with an interest and/or implementation in "CouchDB-style replication" to join this documentation and testing effort. We hope to build community around our shared strength regardless of our implementation or distribution channel choices.</p>
