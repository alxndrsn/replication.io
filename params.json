{"name":"replication.io","tagline":"multi-master replication. defined.","body":"### What is replication.io\r\n\r\n[replication.io](http://replication.io/) is intended to be a community center for databases and services that support \"Apache CouchDB-style replication.\" We are working on building out the definition/spec, testing compatibility, and exploring what's next for multi-master, MVCC-based replication.\r\n\r\n### Why this is needed\r\n\r\n[Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) was created with multi-master replication built into its foundation. The list of databases supporting this multi-master replication style continues to grow. The goal of this project and web site is to combine our communities around our shared strength.\r\n\r\n### Who this is for\r\n\r\nUsers. Freeing user data to move with the user--among all the various types of devices they use now and will use in the future--is key to going \"beyond the cloud\" and enabling an Internet of Things that is sustainable and resilient.\r\n\r\n### Beyond Databases?\r\n\r\nThe replication format and process is a simple exchange of document and revision identifiers. It has been implemented in single node, multi node, mobile, and even web browser-based databases. It can go even farther. Anything that can support a by-sequence index and tracks changes to all the contents of something (be it a database, a file system, web service, or even hardware-monitored storage), could support multi-master replication.\r\n\r\n### Collaborate and Contribute\r\n\r\nWe encourage anyone with an interest and/or implementation in \"CouchDB-style replication\" to join this documentation and testing effort. We hope to build community around our shared strength regardless of our implementation or distribution channel choices.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
